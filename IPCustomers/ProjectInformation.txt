This is a simple made project on Visual Studio executing a similar function like SQL. In the first input loop,
we write down the data of all the IP address buyers (their first and last name, the ip address they are buying and their mobile number).
Once the information about them is valid, the data is stored in the program.
After we are done with all the inputs, we can check the results in the second loop.
There are several commands to do that:
- "Show IPs" - Shows all of the ip addresses we sold from each class.
- "Show IPs count" - Shows the count of all the ip addresses that we sold.
- "Show database" - Shows the stored data with all the information.
