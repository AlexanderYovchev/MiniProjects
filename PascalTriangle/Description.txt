This task is from CodeWars. There are two input integers given.
The triangle would be built, based on the size of the integer (n) that is given.
The target of this task is to sum all of the numbers of a given diagonal.

The integer (n) represents the length of the sides of the triangle (Since the triangle is isosceles).
The integer (p) represents positions of the diagonal that we want to sum all of its indexes.

Here's an example:
int n = 3;
int p = 2;

The triangle would look like this:	1
				       1 1	
				      1 2 1
				     1 3 3 1

NOTE: We always start from index 0.
In this case the diagonal (p) contains 1 and 3.
So the result would be:
int sum = 3 + 1 = 4.
